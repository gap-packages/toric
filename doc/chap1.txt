  [33X[0;0YThis  manual describes the [5Xtoric[105X package for working with toric varieties in
  [5XGAP[105X.  Toric  varieties  can be dealt with more easily than general varieties
  since  often  times  questions  about a toric variety can be reformulated in
  terms  of  combinatorial  geometry.  Some  coding theory commands related to
  toric  varieties  are  contained in the error-correcting codes [5XGUAVA[105X package
  (for  example,  the  command  [10XToricCode[110X).  We  refer  to  the  [5XGUAVA[105X  manual
  [JFDJCTRMTBRBJCM09] and the expository paper [JV02] for more details.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5Xtoric[105X  package  also  contains  several  commands  unrelated  to  toric
  varieties  (mostly  for  list manipulations). These will not be described in
  this documention but they are briefly documented in the [10Xlib/util.gd[110X file.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[5Xtoric[105X  is implemented in the [5XGAP[105X language, and runs on any system supporting
  [5XGAP[105X4.3 and above. The [5Xtoric[105X package is loaded with the command[133X

  [33X[0;0YRather  than  sketch  the  theory of toric varieties, we refer to [JV02] and
  [Ful93]  for  details.  However,  we  briefly  describe some terminology and
  notation.[133X

  [33X[0;0YLet  [22XF[122X  denote  a  field  and  [22XR=F [x_1,...,x_n][122X be a ring in [22Xn[122X variables. A

  [33X[0;0Ywhere  [22Xk_i  â‰¥ 0, â„“_j â‰¥ 0[122X are integers. A binomial variety is a subvariety of
  affine  [22Xn[122X-space  [22XA_F^n[122X defined by a finite set of binomial equations (such a
  variety need not be normal). A typical ``toric variety'' is binomial, though
  they  will be introduced via an [13Xa priori[113X independent construction. The basic
  idea  of the construction is to replace each such binomial equation as above
  by  a  relation  in  a semigroup contained in a lattice and replace [22XR[122X by the
  ``group  algebra''  of this semigroup. By the way, a toric variety is always
  normal (see for example, [Ful93], page 29).[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[13X  By  abuse  of  terminology, from now on a [12Xcone[112X of [22XL_0[122X is a strongly convex

  determined  by  [22XH[122X.  A  [12Xray[112X  (or  edge)  of a cone is a one-dimensional face.
  Typically,  cones  are  represented in [5Xtoric[105X by the list of vectors defining
  their  rays. The [12Xdimension[112X of a cone is the dimension of the vector space it
  spans.  The [5Xtoric[105X package can test if a given vector is in a given cone (see

  [33X[0;0YA  fan is a collection of cones which ``fit together'' well. A [12Xfan[112X in [22XL_0[122X is

  [33X[0;0YIn particular, the face of a cone in a fan is a cone is the fan.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf  [22XV[122X  is  the  (set-theoretic) union of the cones in [22Xâˆ†[122X then we call the fan
  [12Xcomplete[112X.  We  shall assume that all fans are finite. A fan is determined by
  its list of maximal cones.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XNotation[113X:  A  fan  [22Xâˆ†[122X  is represented in [5Xtoric[105X as a set of maximal cones. For
  example,  if  [22Xâˆ†[122X  is the fan with maximal cones [22XÏƒ_1=Q_+â‹… f_1+Q_+â‹… (-f_1+f_2)[122X,
  [22XÏƒ_2=Q_+â‹… (-f_1+f_2)+Q_+â‹… (-f_1-f_2)[122X, [22XÏƒ_3=Q_+â‹… (-f_1-f_2)+Q_+â‹… f_1[122X, then [22Xâˆ†[122X is
  represented by [22X[[[1,0],[-1,1]],[[-1,1],[-1,-1]],[[-1,-1],[1,0]]][122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [5Xtoric[105X  package can compute all cones in a fan of a given dimension (see
  [10XConesOfFan[110X).  Moreover,  [5Xtoric[105X  can compute the set of all normal vectors to
  the faces (i.e., hyperplanes) of a cone (see [10XFaces[110X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe [12Xstar[112X of a cone [22XÏƒ[122X in a fan [22Xâˆ†[122X is the set [22Xâˆ†_Ïƒ[122X of cones in [22Xâˆ†[122X containing [22XÏƒ[122X as

  We  may  interprete [22XR_Ïƒ[122X as a subring of [22XR=F [x_1,...,x_n][122X as follows: First,
  identify  each  [22Xe_i^*[122X  with  the  variable  [22Xx_i[122X.  If  [22XS_Ïƒ[122X  is generated as a

  integer,  then  its  image  in  [22XR[122X  is  generated  by  monomials  of the form
  [22Xx_1^â„“_1dots   x_n^â„“_n[122X.  The  [5Xtoric[105X  package  can  compute  these  generating
  monomials  (see  [10XEmbeddingAffineToricVariety[110X).  See Lemma 2.14 in [JV02] for
  more details. This embedding can also be used to resolve singularities - see
  section 5 of [JV02] for more details.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThis defines an [12Xaffine toric variety[112X (associated to [22XÏƒ[122X). It is known that the
  coordinate  ring  [22XR_Ïƒ[122X  of  the  affine  toric variety [22XU_Ïƒ[122X has the form [22XR_Ïƒ =
  F[x_1,...,x_n]/J[122X,  where  [22XJ[122X  is  an  ideal.  The  [5Xtoric[105X  package can compute
  generators  of  this  ideal  by  using  the  [10XDualSemigroupGenerators[110X and the
  [10XEmbeddingAffineToricVariety[110X commands.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YRoughly speaking, the toric variety [22XX(âˆ†)[122X associated to the fan [22Xâˆ†[122X is given by
  a collection of affine pieces $U_{\sigma_1},U_{\sigma_2},\dots,U_{\sigma_d}$
  which  ``glue''  together  (where [22Xâˆ† = {Ïƒ_i}[122X). The affine pieces are given by
  the  zero sets of polynomial equations in some affine spaces and the gluings
  are  given  by  maps  [22XÏ•_i,j  :  U_Ïƒ_i â†’ U_Ïƒ_j[122X which are defined by ratios of
  polynomials  on  open  subsets of the $U_{\sigma_i}$. The [5Xtoric[105X package does
  [13Xnot[113X compute these gluings or work directly with these (non-affine) varieties
  [22XX(âˆ†)[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA cone [22XÏƒ âŠ‚ V[122X is said to be [12Xnonsingular[112X if it is generated by part of a basis
  for  the  lattice [22XL_0[122X. A fan [22Xâˆ†[122X of cones is said to be [12Xnonsingular[112X if all its
  cones  are nonsingular. It is known that [22XU_Ïƒ[122X is nonsingular if and only if [22XÏƒ[122X
  is nonsingular (Proposition 2.1 in [Ful93]).[133X

  [22XÏµ_i=Â±  1[122X  and [22X1â‰¤ inot= jâ‰¤ 3[122X. There are 8 cones per octant, for a total of 64

  [22XX(âˆ†)[122X, it can compute objects associated with it. For example, it can compute
  the  Euler  characteristic  (see  [10XEulerCharacteristic[110X),  Betti  numbers (see
  [10XBettiNumberToric[110X),   and   the   number   of   GF(q)-rational   points  (see

  [33X[0;0YFor  an  algebraic  variety [22XX[122X the group of [12XWeil divisors[112X on [22XX[122X is the abelian
